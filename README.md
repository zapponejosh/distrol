# DistroL

**WIP**

## Original Idea and Notes:

This is an app for giving life updates to your friends and family

You can invite friends via phone or text to create an account and join your DL

When they join your DL you are mutually added to their general DL

Extra features: Multiple lists, unlimited updates, frequency

You can use the online editor to create an email that will be sent to everyone on the list (they can also select to have a link to a page texted to them). These updates will be archived for later viewing. Members of your DL can select their notification settings.

The idea is similar to Christmas letters to family or facebook posts.

I want FB to inform my friends and family of life updates but i do not want to have a facebook (ðŸ¤®)

Go backend with MySQL (maybe postgres?) database
React frontend (CRA) using Redux for state, atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop, Chakra-ui for the eyes, and something for the editor... maybe a markdown editor.
Probably using Sendgrid for communication at some point.
