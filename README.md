# DistroL

## Original Idea and Notes:

This is an app for giving life updates to your friends and family!

You can invite friends via phone or text to create an account and join your DL

When they join your DL you are mutually added to their general DL

Premium: Multiple lists, unlimited updates

You can use the online editor to create an email that will be sent to everyone on the list (they can also select to have a link to a page texted to them). These updates will be archived for later viewing.

The idea is sort of like Christmas letters or facebook posts.

I want FB to inform my friends and family of life updates but i do not want to have a facebook
